### Overview
Robinhood is an online trading platform created in 2013 by Vladmir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt with the intent of making trading available to the masses. The idea for Robinhood came from the two founders' time working in finance in New York where they realized how disproportianate disadvantaged the everyday man is compared to the larger finance firms. While Wall Street firms paid effectively nothing to trade stocks, most Americans were charged commission for every trade *(Robinhood)*.

### Business Activities
While it is a relatively new company, Robinhood has achieved success in disrupting the financial sector by providing inexpensive services that are easily accessible by a mobile platform. This sets Robinhood apart from its competitors, such as TD Ameritrade, WeBull, Charles Schwab, and E-Trade. Robinhood was also one of the first trading brokerage companies to appeal to a younger audience, who weren't a part of the niche group that most financial companies catered to. The introduction of commission-free trading has forced traditional brokerage firms to adapt and cater more to the masses in order to compete with Robinhood. One main element behind the magnitude of Robinhood's success, was the COVID pandemic in 2019. Robinhood flourished during these times where people where stuck at home and had either limited options or a large amount of time on hand. According to Forbes, just within the first quarter of 2020, Robinhood added a record 3 million new accounts to its platform. In order to provide its services to such a large group, Robinhood uses AWS in order to operate its mobile trading app and securely store customer information and trading data (Amazon).

### Prognosi
Robinhood has recently gone public and is valued at around 31 billion dollars. As a company on the forefront of the *free trading* revolution *(US News)* it has the ability to reshape the financial sector as we know it. However, due to ongoing legal battles *(CNBC)* and a post-pandemic normal returning, there is a possibility that Robinhood's growth could slow down, thus making it a risky investment in the long term.
