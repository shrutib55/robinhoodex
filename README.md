### General
Robinhood is a trading platform created in 2013 with the intent of making trading available to the masses. 
While it is a relatively new company, Robinhood has achieved success in disrupting the financial sector by providing inexpensive services that are eassily accessible by a mobile platform. This sets Robinhood apart from its competitors who use PC platforms, as a mobile app attracts a larger millenial base.
A main element behind the success of Robinhood, was the COVID pandemic in 2019. Robinhood flourished during these times where people where stuck at home and had either limited options or a large amount of time on hand. 
### Prognosis
Robinhood has recently gone public and is valued at around 31 billion dollars. As a company on the forefront of the *free trading revolution* it has the ability to reshape the financial sector as we know it. However, due to ongoing legal battles and a post-pandemic normal returning, there is a possibility that Robinhood's growth could slow down.
