Robinhood is a trading platform created in 2013 with the intent of making trading available to the masses. 
While it is a relatively new company, Robinhood has achieved success in disrupting the financial sector by providing inexpensive services that are eassily accessible by a mobile platform. 
This sets Robinhood apart from its competitors who use PC platforms, as a mobile app attracts a larger millenial base.
